                    <p class="description">
                      The photography timeline extends back further than you might assume.
          In the 4th Century BC, Aristotle described the principles of the
          camera obscura, which entails projecting an image through a small
          hole.  While our notion of a camera has evolved
          dramatically, the “camera obscura” is considered to be block upon which all further developments
           in the field of photography were built.

                    <p class="description">
                      Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Daguerre are often considered the
          inventors of photography with cameras, as we now know it. In 1826, Niépce succeeded in taking the first true camera
          photograph. Painter Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre was so excited about this
          achievement that he decided to partner with Niépce and in 1839 they presented the
          daguerreotype.

                      In 1889, George Eastman created the roll of film, which made it possible to shoot multiple pictures 
                      one after the other. He released it through his company, Kodak. It was an immediate breakthrough in
                       the practical application of photography. It made snapshots possible, as images no longer needed to
                        be immediately and individually processed.

                      While the concept of digital cameras has existed since the 1960s, the Eastman Kodak camera 
                      designed by Steven Sasson in 1975 is generally considered to be the first self-contained 
                      digital camera. Much like photography with film, advances in digital technology have led to 
                      explosive growth in the medium’s popularity.
